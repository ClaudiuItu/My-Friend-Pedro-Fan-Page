        <p class="content">HI! Hello! Thank you for checking out my website, this is my first real website project created with the intent to learn HTML and CSS(don't know javascript yet but well! SOON <br>
        I am in no way associated with the developers behind 🍌My Friend Pedro🍌(Dead Toast Entertainment) or their publisher (Devolver Digital), this is only a fan project <br>
        The project took about 3 days of work to finish and about 702 lines of code(excluding the code on this page of course, I'm making it as I'm writing this lmao) and about 50 million trips to google.com <br>
        You can either return to the main page using the button below (home) or press the end button to leave the site, thanks again for visiting!</p>
        <p class="bye">ADIOS!</p>
